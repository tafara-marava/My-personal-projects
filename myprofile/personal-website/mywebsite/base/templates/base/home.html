					<h4>Aspiring Software Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>After watching my older brother write code for more than 4 years, I began to understand why he was so passionate about it. Obviously, I never had the mental capacity to comprehend what he was doing, or to understand what the applications he was building were actually meant to accomplish. One day I came to understand the joy of knowing that you have created something that everyone can use to make their lives better. Even though I knew nothing about programming at the time, I still understood the impact it had on peopleâ€™s lives, and that is when my desire to become a programmer just like my brother was born.</p>

					<p>I wrote my first Hello World program as a BYU-Pathway Worldwide student in 2021, and my resolve to learn more about programming as not changed ever since. As an individual that loves to learn something new every day, be it from school or from my peers,  this has been a very fulfilling journey for me.

					<h5>My Experience as a Developer</h5>
					<hr>
					
					<p>
						My experience as a developer so far has only been through the various classes I have taken in college. I one of the classes that I am taking, I am working with a team to create an mobile app that uses a pie chart to illustrate different tasks that can be done throughout the day and the timeframes in which they will be done. This will help increase productivity in many people, especially those who may find it hard to stay motivated.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
				

					<p>I consider myself a visual and practical learner. By this, I mean that I learm most effectively when I visualize the concepts I am learning and put them into practice. I do this by coding along with tutorials I see online from various sources such as YouTube and Udemy. Documentation is also very helpful for me as it helps me remember certain functions and libraries that I may not have their knowledge of at my fingertips.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>My current goals right now are to gain as much knowledge as I can so that I can be more marketable, especially now that I am currently looking for internships. I want to do more and more projects; that way I will gain more coding experience.</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
